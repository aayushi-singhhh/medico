  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  role: "patient" | "doctor",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  authProvider: "email" | "google", // Tracks authentication method
  
  // Doctor-specific fields
  license: "MD123456" (doctors only),
  specialization: "Cardiology" (doctors only),
  profileCompleted: true (doctors only - indicates complete medical credentials),
  updatedAt: "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z" (timestamp when profile was last updated)
}
```

## Authentication States

### Loading State
- Shown while checking authentication status
- Displays loading spinner
- Prevents flash of login/dashboard content

### Authenticated State
- User data available via `useAuth()` hook
- Access to protected routes
- Personalized content

### Unauthenticated State

- Registration and login available

## Usage Examples

### Using Authentication in Components
```tsx
import { useAuth } from "../contexts/AuthContext";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { user, userData, loading, logout } = useAuth();
  
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  
  if (!user) return <div>Please log in</div>;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {userData?.firstName}!</h1>
      <p>Role: {userData?.role}</p>
      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Creating Protected Routes
```tsx
<Route 
  path="/protected-page" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute requiredRole="patient">
      <PatientOnlyPage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>
```

## Security Features

1. **Role Validation**: Users cannot access pages for other roles
2. **Authentication Required**: Protected routes require valid authentication
3. **Secure Storage**: User data stored in Firestore with proper security
4. **Session Management**: Automatic logout handling
5. **Input Validation**: Form validation on registration and login

## Next Steps

To further enhance the authentication system, consider:

2. **Password Reset**: Implement forgot password functionality
3. **Profile Management**: Allow users to update their profiles
4. **Admin Panel**: Create admin role for managing users
5. **Enhanced Security**: Add two-factor authentication
6. **Social Login**: Add Google/Facebook authentication options

## Testing

To test the authentication system:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/register` and create test accounts
3. Try logging in with different role selections
4. Test protected route access
5. Verify logout functionality
6. Check dashboard personalization

The authentication system is now fully integrated and ready for use!

### Error Scenarios
- **Popup Blocked**: Browser blocks popup - shows appropriate error
- **Authentication Cancelled**: User cancels Google auth - returns to form
- **Network Issues**: Connection problems - displays network error message

   - Basic profile created with placeholder medical credentials
   - **Automatic redirect to profile completion page**

2. **Profile Completion (Required)**:
   - Doctor must provide medical license number
   - Doctor must specify medical specialization
   - Optional phone number for patient communication
   - Security information about credential storage
   - Profile marked as complete upon submission

3. **Dashboard Access**:
   - Only doctors with complete profiles can access dashboard
   - Incomplete profiles automatically redirected to completion page
   - Dashboard shows personalized doctor information
   - Profile can be edited via header button

### Enhanced Security for Doctors
- **Medical Credential Validation**: License and specialization required
